{
  "secret": "Sparky_Bot_Secret_XYZ123",
  "exchange": "tradier",
  "action": "buy",
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "orderType": "market",
  "stop_loss_percent": 2.0,

```

### Important Notes:

**Symbol Format:**
- ‚úÖ Use ticker symbols: `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `SPY`, `QQQ`

**Minimum Position:**
- Make sure `tradeAmount` is high enough to buy at least 1 share
- For high-priced stocks (like TSLA, NVDA), increase `tradeAmount`

## üéØ Strategy Examples

### Day Trading Strategy (Market Hours Only)

```javascript
//@version=5
strategy("Day Trading - Stocks", overlay=true)

// Your day trading logic
rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14)

longCondition = ta.crossover(rsi, 30)
shortCondition = ta.crossunder(rsi, 70)

if longCondition
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
    alert('{"secret":"your-secret","exchange":"tradier","action":"buy","symbol":"{{ticker}}","stop_loss_percent":2,"take_profit_percent":5}')

if shortCondition
    strategy.close("Long")
    alert('{"secret":"your-secret","exchange":"tradier","action":"close","symbol":"{{ticker}}"}')
```

### Swing Trading Strategy (Multi-Day)

```javascript
//@version=5
strategy("Swing Trading - Stocks", overlay=true)

// Moving average crossover
fastMA = ta.sma(close, 10)
slowMA = ta.sma(close, 30)

longSignal = ta.crossover(fastMA, slowMA)
shortSignal = ta.crossunder(fastMA, slowMA)

if longSignal
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
    alert('{"secret":"your-secret","exchange":"tradier","action":"buy","symbol":"{{ticker}}","stop_loss_percent":3,"take_profit_percent":10}')

if shortSignal
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short)
    alert('{"secret":"your-secret","exchange":"tradier","action":"sell","symbol":"{{ticker}}","stop_loss_percent":3,"take_profit_percent":10}')
```

## üïí Market Hours

### Stock Market Hours (Eastern Time):
- **Regular**: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET
- **Pre-Market**: 8:00 AM - 9:30 AM ET (some brokers)
- **After-Hours**: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM ET (some brokers)

### Trading Considerations:
- ‚úÖ Orders placed during market hours execute immediately
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Orders placed outside hours are queued for market open
- ‚úÖ Tradier supports extended hours (check your account)
- üìÖ Markets closed: Weekends, US holidays

### Check Market Status:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.tradier.com/v1/markets/clock" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
```

## üí° Position Sizing for Stocks

### How It Works:

**Example 1: Affordable Stock (AAPL @ $150)**
```
tradeAmount: $500
Stock Price: $150
Calculation: $500 √∑ $150 = 3.33 shares
Rounded: 3 shares (whole shares only)
Actual Position: 3 √ó $150 = $450
```

**Example 2: Expensive Stock (NVDA @ $450)**
```
tradeAmount: $500
Stock Price: $450
Calculation: $500 √∑ $450 = 1.11 shares
Rounded: 1 share
Actual Position: 1 √ó $450 = $450
```

**Example 3: Too Expensive (TSLA @ $250 with $100 position)**
```
tradeAmount: $100
Stock Price: $250
Calculation: $100 √∑ $250 = 0.4 shares
Rounded: 0 shares ‚ùå
Result: Trade rejected (can't buy fractional shares)
```

### Recommendations:
- **Low-priced stocks** ($5-$50): `tradeAmount: 100-500`
- **Mid-priced stocks** ($50-$200): `tradeAmount: 500-1000`
- **High-priced stocks** ($200+): `tradeAmount: 1000+` or use cheaper alternatives

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Differences: Stocks vs Crypto

| Feature | Crypto (Aster) | Stocks (Tradier) |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Trading Hours** | 24/7 | 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET |
| **Weekends** | Open | Closed |
| **Holidays** | Open | Closed |
| **Shares** | Fractional (0.001) | Whole shares only |
| **Leverage** | Up to 125x | Up to 2x (margin) |
| **Settlement** | Instant | T+2 (2 days) |
| **Pattern Day Trading** | No rules | <$25k account limited |

### Pattern Day Trading Rule (PDT):
- **Applies to**: Accounts under $25,000
- **Limit**: 3 day trades per 5 trading days
- **Day Trade**: Buy and sell same stock in same day
- **Workaround**: Use swing trading (hold overnight)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Market is Closed" Error
**Problem**: Order placed outside market hours.

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for market open (9:30 AM ET)
2. Use extended hours (if your account supports)
3. Check market calendar:
```bash
curl https://sandbox.tradier.com/v1/markets/calendar
```

### "Insufficient Funds" Error
**Problem**: Not enough buying power.

**Solution:** Check your balance:
```bash
curl https://sandbox.tradier.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/balances
```

### "0 Shares Calculated" Error
**Problem**: Stock too expensive for `tradeAmount`.

**Solution:** Increase `tradeAmount` in config.json or choose cheaper stocks.

### "PDT Rule Violation"
**Problem**: Too many day trades with <$25k account.

**Solutions:**
1. Deposit to reach $25k
2. Switch to swing trading (hold overnight)
3. Space out trades (max 3 per 5 days)

## üéì Best Practices

### 1. Start with Sandbox
- ‚úÖ Always test with sandbox first
- ‚úÖ Verify your strategies work
- ‚úÖ Then switch to live: `"environment": "live"`

### 2. Position Sizing
```json
{
  "tradeAmount": 500,  // Enough for 1-3 shares of most stocks
}
```

### 3. Stop Losses for Stocks
- **Tech stocks**: 2-3% (volatile)
- **Blue chips**: 1-2% (stable)
- **Penny stocks**: 5-10% (very volatile)

### 4. Watch Market Hours
- Set TradingView alerts to only fire during market hours
- Or accept that orders will queue until market open

### 5. Monitor PDT
- Track your day trades if under $25k
- Use swing strategies to avoid PDT issues
